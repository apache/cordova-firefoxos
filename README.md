Introduction
------------

[Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) is an open source operating system for smartphones and tablet computers being developed by Mozilla. It is designed to allow HTML5 applications to integrate directly with the device's hardware using JavaScript.

cordova-firefoxos allows developers to use the cross platform APIs in Cordova to target the Firefox OS. Most APIs are just proxied to the matching Firefox OS API calls.

Prerequisties
==============

There are no prerequisites for adding Firefox OS as a Cordova platform. For usage, setting up debugging environment and running on the device, see the [Cordova support for Firefox OS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Tools_and_frameworks/Cordova_support_for_Firefox_OS) page on Mozilla Developer Network.

For platform development information, check out the [Firefox OS cordova development page](http://mozilla-cordova.github.io)

A lot of good documentation on Firefox OS development is also available on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS).
